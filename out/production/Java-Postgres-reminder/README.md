# Java-Postgres-reminder

this repository is designed for work on Java+Postgresql Reminders and Spring framework familiarization.

## Introduction

This project aims to consolidate your knowledge of Java, implementing the principles of object-oriented programming (O.O.P.) and familiarizing you with the Spring framework for developing a REST API. In this tutorial, we'll concentrate on Java basics and initial configuration with PostgreSQL, before moving on to integration with Spring.

## Project context

The project is an extension of library management, involving books, authors, subscribers (visitors), and administrators. The aim is to create a system for borrowing and returning books, with specific functionality for administrators.
